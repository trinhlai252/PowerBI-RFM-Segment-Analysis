# [SQL] Explore Ecommerce Dataset
## I. Introduction
This project contains an eCommerce dataset that I will explore using SQL on [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery). The dataset is based on the Google Analytics public dataset and contains data from an eCommerce website.
## II. Business question
Customer Behavior doesn't describe who is shopping in your store, it describes how they shop there. It looks at factors like how often they shop, their product preferences, and how they feel about your marketing, sales, and service. Understanding these details helps businesses communicate with customers in an effective way. To understand customer behavior, we also need to classify customers into separate groups with the same behavioral tendencies or common characteristics (Customer Segmentation). For example, demographic classification based on age, gender, income, education level, and marital status; geographical classification based on continent, country, region, city, or town; or psychological classification based on personality, attitude, worldview, and interest.
Requirement: Apply customer transaction data to perform RFM analysis.
* Clearly present customer segments within the business and the performance of each segment.
* Provide appropriate suggestions for maintaining/developing/retaining/attracting each customer segment

Dataset access:
* Log in to your Google Cloud Platform account and create a new project.
* Navigate to the BigQuery console and select your newly created project.
* In the navigation panel, select "Add Data" and then "Star a project by name".

Access BigQuery data from Power BI Desktop
* Launch Power BI and find the Get Data option in Home
* Search for the ODBC option from the data source list; select it, and click on Connect
* Select the DSN from the dropdown and click OK
* Connect BigQuery. The first time you connect to this DSN, you might need to enter the username, password and optional credential connection string properties and click Connect.
* Click Load to load all selected data from BigQuery.
